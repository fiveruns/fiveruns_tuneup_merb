See http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/10/11/fiveruns-tuneup-for-merb for the announcement.

== Installation

1. Install the gem:

  sudo gem install fiveruns_tuneup_merb

2. Add the following to your desired environment file (eg, config/environments/development.rb):

  dependency 'fiveruns_tuneup_merb'

3. Run the following in your Merb.root:

  rake slices:fiveruns_tuneup_merb:install

4. Add the following to your config/router.rb:

  slice FiverunsTuneupMerb
  
(If you're already mounting other slices with `all_slices' this step isn't necessary.)

5. Start your app!

== Sharing

To enable run sharing on the http://tuneup.fiveruns.com service, you need to configure the slice with an API key. Create an account at http://tuneup.fiveruns.com/users/new and look at your profile to find your it.

In your environment file (ie, config/environments/development.rb), add the API key:

  Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
    Merb::Slices.config[:fiveruns_tuneup_merb][:api_key] = 'YOUR-API-KEY'
  end	
  
When you restart your application, a "Share this run" link on the TuneUp panel should appear.
